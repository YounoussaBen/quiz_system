## **Introduction**

The Quiz Game System is a Django-based web application designed for interactive learning with a competitive edge. The system has two types of users: admins and normal users. Admins can create topics, set quizzes, and manage questions. Normal users can sign up, take quizzes, score points, earn badges, and view their rankings. Quizzes are categorized by difficulty, and users must complete easier levels before unlocking harder ones.
